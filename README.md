Rscripts and data for the Understanding Political Numbers Class

This repository contains rscripts for the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison class Political Science 270: Understanding Political Numbers.

The scripts start at section 2 because section 1 is just introductions. The scripts assume that you have tidyverse installed and that you are in the rproject that this repository contains.
