Rscripts and data for the Understanding Political Numbers Class

This repository contains rscripts for the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison class Political Science 270: Understanding Political Numbers.

# Setup/prerequisites
The scripts assume that you have R, Rstudio, and tidyverse installed. They also assume that you are working within the rproject that this repository contains.

# Explaination
The scripts folder contains the Rscripts we will use in section. The scripts start at section 2 because section 1 is just introductions. The data folder contains the data we will use in the form of csv files. The figures folder is an empty directory that our scripts will use to save plots.
